<h1>Holidays & College Student Mental Wellness <span>Hannah Hughes</span></h1>

<article>
 <p><span class="dropcap">T</span> he most wonderful time of the year, some might say, is the holiday season. From mid-November to early January, people all over the world celebrate their own traditions and holidays. Although joyful for many, the season brings a lot of stress, especially to college students.  


 <p>The holiday season comes in at a strange intersection for these students, because winter break usually marks the end of their semester. So, although the weeks may be filled with holiday cheer, they also bring final exams, projects and presentations. In fact, in a survey with 48 responses from college students, ages 18 to 22, across 16 U.S schools and universities, participants listed work and school as a top stressor at this time of year, followed by gift giving and family dynamics. </p>

 <p>Although not specifically detailed in the data above,  <a href="https://emerson.edu/faculty-staff-directory/mollie-hamilton" target= "new"> Dr. Mollie Hamilton, Scholar-In-Residence at Emerson College,</a> also agreed that loneliness and isolation as a factor, especially in college students. "You're kind of isolated away from your home and community... You are trying to prepare for going home." Dr. Hamilton explained that after being away from a familiar environment, you may have changed and adapted to your new one. Now, students may be asking themselves: "how can I go home and be this person that people expect me to be?" Dr. Hamilton explains. </a></p>

 <p>Final exams don't seem to help, adding more pressure on students when they already may be dealing with overarching issues and feelings. "Up until finals are over, I feel overwhelmed with this sense of stress and dread," said 20-year-old college student Kayla Burrows, "[College] makes you feel guilty for not focusing on school, or being ready to be done with the semester."" </p>

<p> Although this may sound hopeless, this stress comes with an interesting counterpart. Despite the 41.7% of students that reported an excess amount of stress, 85.4% of the students said the holidays also bring them joy. In fact, 93.8% of these students said they look forward to this time of year!</p>

<p> So, with college students wanting to enjoy this time of year, there are two questions we have to ask here:</p>

 <ul> 
  <li class="list">What can schools do to help their students manage their stress?</li>
  <li class="list">What steps can people personally take to cope with this stress?</li>

 <p>As a place to start, Dr. Hamilton suggests we start being kinder to one another. "I think we just have to be treating people like people," she said, "the second someone is like 'I'm in this in you, and we're doing this... we're figuring this out,' I think that makes everything better." </p>

<p> Other students surveyed had their own ways of coping with stress, with popular answers including sleeping, listening to music, and confiding in a trusted friend or loved one. </p>
